This repository is my personal learning journal where I document everything I learn while exploring Linux, Windows internals, networking, cybersecurity, and system fundamentals.

The goal of this repo is to:

1.Build strong fundamentals
2.Learn by doing
3.Track daily progress
4.Create clear, revision-friendly notes
5.Share knowledge in my own words

This is a living repository and will be updated regularly as I continue learning.
